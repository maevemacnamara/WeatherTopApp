Once accessed, the latest reading is presented in a grid with calculations being performed to achieve additional data measurements and semantic ui icons are displayed within the grid.
Below is a table cataloguing all the readings entered for that station.
Each reading may be deleted by selecting the associated delete button on each line of the table.
When the latest reading is deleted, the next most-latest reading will be read into the top grid displaying the latest reading.
When all readings are deleted, the latest reading top grid and reading table will be empty.
